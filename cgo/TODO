Which optimizations can benefit from these:
\Phi for all forward propagation optimizations like jump threading. (will be fully/partially available analysis)
\chi for all backward propagation optimizations (can be precomputed).

cost-model of live range not good, make the modification as per the review in cgo/cc


Reduce register pressure
Essentially, if there is
one killed operand, code hoisting will either decrease
or preserve the register pressure as long as the hoisting
of killed operands does not cross a use. Similarly, code-
sinking (of an instructions which defines a register) will
either decrease or preserve the register pressure as long
as there is one operand killed at most and the instruction
is not sunk below the killing use of a non-killed operand.
